# Predicting COVID-19 Using Lung X-Rays

A machine learning model was developed using CNNs and dense neural networks
to see if a person is COVID positive or not just using the Lung X-ray of that person.

About 250 images were used for testing, validation and training in turns with data augmentation

The final accuracy achived was 97%
